Simple Course Creator Front Display
=====================

This is an add-on plugin for use with the [Simple Course Creator](https://github.com/sdavis2702/simple-course-creator) plugin.

Simple Course Creator is designed to easily link posts together in a series and output that series list in the content of each included post.

The Simple Course Creator Front Display add-on outputs that course name on each post listed on the blog, archives, and search results. If a post is not part of a course, nothing displays. SCC Front Display behaves just like a typical byline displaying post meta information. It will not show on the individual post.

### How It Works
---

SCC Front Display requires no settings. Once you install it, it works. However, it does have built-in customization options in the theme customizer.

If you have [Simple Course Creator Customizer](http://buildwpyourself.com/downloads/scc-customizer/) installed, the options will merge seamlessly into one customizer section.

### Theme Overrides
---

SCC Front Display will output complete sentences on your posts. You're in control of every word. The text that displays before your course name and after your course name can be filtered like so.

For the leading text:

```php
function your_filter_name( $content ) {
	$content = str_replace( 'This post is part of the', 'Course:', $content );
	return $content;
}
add_filter( 'course_leading_text', 'your_filter_name' );
```

For the trailing text:

```php
function your_other_filter_name( $content ) {
	$content = str_replace( 'course.', '', $content );
	return $content;
}
add_filter( 'course_trailing_text', 'your_other_filter_name' );
```

Those two filters will result in the following output:

Customize the output to have its own style or blend it in with your byline. The freedom is yours.
